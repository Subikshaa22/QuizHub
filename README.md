# QuizHub
QuizHub is a command-line interface (CLI) platform developed as a course project, showcasing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java and C++. It provides a dynamic and user-friendly solution for creating, attempting, and managing quizzes. Designed for individual users, educators, and administrators, it enables seamless quiz creation, participation, and progress tracking while demonstrating the power of OOP concepts in real-world applications.
